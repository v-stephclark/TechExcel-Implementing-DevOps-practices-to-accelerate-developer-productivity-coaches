# Exercise 04 Solution - Implement load testing and secure practices

## Lab Scenario

Load testing is a critical part of quality control for an application. In this exercise, you will create a load testing strategy based on information you will receive from Munson's Pickles and Preserves. Then, you will create a load test using a popular load testing solution: Apache JMeter. After creating a load test plan in JMeter, you will then import it into an Azure Load Test and create a GitHub Actions workflow to execute this Azure Load Test on demand. Finally, you will create two additional types of test in Azure: stress tests and chaos tests.

## Objectives

After you complete this lab, you will be able to:

* Create a load test strategy based on service utilization patterns at a customer
* Create a load test plan in Apache JMeter
* Deploy and execute an Apache JMeter load test plan in the Azure Load Test service
* Execute Azure Load Tests as part of GitHub Actions workflows
* Stress test a .NET application running on Azure App Services
* Chaos test a .NET application running on Azure App Services

## Lab Duration

* **Estimated Time:** 120 minutes
