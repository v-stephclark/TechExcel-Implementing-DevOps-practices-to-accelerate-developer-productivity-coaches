# Exercise 01 Solution - Set up development environment

## Lab Scenario

Munson's Pickles and Preserves has a large number of developers on their team, working on a variety of projects. One of those projects is the Team Messaging System. A challenge that Munson's Pickles and Preserves has with development is getting developers machines configured properly in a timely manner when they need to work on these projects.

Developers occasionally will also be working on two projects simultaneously that require different configurations or various versions for the same software packages, making it challenging to keep their development computer consistent when working on the two projects. In the past, MPP has also had issues with one developer’s computer being configured slightly differently that another developer’s so the code they were developing behaved differently in different circumstances.

Within Microsoft Azure, Microsoft has created Microsoft Dev Box as a solution for addressing this issue. It allows an organization to create a virtual desktop environment geared specifically at developers. This allows organizations to ensure that developers are working from machines configured the same way with the same version of software deployed to them. In these next few tasks, you'll configure a Microsoft Dev Box environment.

## Objectives

After you complete this lab, you will be able to:

* Set up an Azure environment to use Microsoft Dev Box
* Create a virtual machine image you can use for subsequent exercises
* Deploy a Microsoft Dev Box using the virtual machine image you have created

## Lab Duration

* **Estimated Time:** 120 minutes
