# Task 03 - Set up a GitHub Actions workflow

- The solution for this task is a YAML file in [the solutions folder](https://github.com/microsoft/TechExcel-Implementing-DevOps-practices-to-accelerate-developer-productivity/blob/main/Coach/Solution/Exercise-02/Task-3/first-workflow.yml).

Each GitHub Actions workflow has a certain structure to it, following the [GitHub Actions workflow syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions). The following is an annotated breakdown of this structure.

```yaml
# The name of the job is what will display on the GitHub repository in the Actions tab.
name: First Workflow

# The 'on' section tells GitHub under what conditions we want to run this workflow.
# https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows
# Common scenarios include:
  # workflow-dispatch (manual execution)
  # issues
  # push
  # pull_request
  # schedule
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  issues:
    types: [opened]

# This section covers the work to perform.
# We include one or more jobs in this section.
jobs:
  # Each individual job will include details like execution order,
  # pre-requisite jobs, and execution platform.
  job1:
    # We can run jobs on GitHub hosted VM runners in Windows, Ubuntu, and Mac OS.
    # We can also run jobs on self-hosted hardware.
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Each job contains one or more steps. A step needs to have at least a name and a command.
    steps:
    - name: Step one
      # The 'run' command executes a shell or command script. Because this is Ubuntu, the
      # default run command will be /bin/bash
      run: echo "Log from step one"
      # This section does not appear in the solution file but demonstrates how to set
      # custom variables that will be available in the run script.
      env:
        VARIABLE_NAME: value
    - name: Step two
      run: echo "Log from step two"
      
  job2:
    # Job 2 will only run after job 1 completes.
    # Removing this 'needs' section would make the jobs run simultaneously.
    needs: job1
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Cowsays
      # The 'uses' command executes a remote GitHub action.
      # A command like mscoutermarsh/cowsays-action means you can
      # find this code at https://github.com/mscoutermarsh/cowsays-action
      uses: mscoutermarsh/cowsays-action@master
      # The 'with' block includes parameters that the workflow will pass
      # to this action. Parameters are all in key-value format.
      with:
        text: 'Ready for prod--ship it!'
        color: 'magenta'
```
