# Task 01 - Set up a GitHub repository

- Some learners create their first repository via GitHub Desktop.  Make sure learners understand how a distributed source control such as Git differs from a centralized source control system such as Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC) or Subversion (SVN).
- To clone a repository via command line, run `git clone $URL` in the directory into which you wish to copy the repository. In order to get the value for URL, perform the following steps:
  - Navigate to your repository in GitHub.
  - Select the green button labeled "<> Code".
  - In the Clone section of the Local tab, select the copy button to get the URL.
- Add the training files into the root of this new directory.
- In the command line, the command `git add --all` will mark for tracking all of the files you just copied to the folder.
- In order to commit changes, type in a command such as `git commit -am "My first commit"`. Note that the commit message can be whatever you wish it to be.
- The final step is to push this code to the remote GitHub repository. To do this, execute the command `git push -u`. If this is the first time you are pushing to a particular GitHub repository, you might see a warning message.
