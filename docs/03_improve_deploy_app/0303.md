# Task 03 - Introduce infrastructure as code

- The following az cli commands will create an application registration and then service principal. This uses a sample app registration name of `TechExcelUser`.
  - `az ad app create --display-name TechExcelUser`. Copy the "appId" output to use in the next command.
  - `az ad sp create --id {appId}`
  - `az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "TechExcelUser" --role contributor --scopes /subscriptions/{subscription_id}/resourceGroups/{resource_group_name} --json-auth`. The output of this command should be the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` secret.
