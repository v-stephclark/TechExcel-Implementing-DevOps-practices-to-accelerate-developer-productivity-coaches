# Task 01 - Configure Microsoft Copilot on your Dev Box

- Microsoft employees have a specific process to access GitHub Copilot with their accounts. They should navigate to [the following link](https://aka.ms/copilot) to sign up. Learners who have already signed up should simply need to sign in using the correct account.
- The GitHub Copilot extension is available in the Visual Studio Code extensions store.
- In order to open the Copilot suggestions window, strike Ctrl+Shift+P in Windows or Linux, and Cmd+Shift+P on Mac to open the navigation menu. Then, enter text until you can select `> GitHub Copilot: Open Completions Panel`.
- GitHub Copilot works on highlighted text, so learners should enter a comment in a `.cs` file, highlight the comment, and review results.
