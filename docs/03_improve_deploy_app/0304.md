# Task 04 - Build, Push, and Deploy Changes

- The solution for this task is a YAML file in the solutions folder. To make the solution easier to understand, there are several versions of the solution file. Each version builds upon the prior, so the final version covers all parts of the solution.
  - The [first version of the solution file](https://github.com/microsoft/TechExcel-Implementing-DevOps-practices-to-accelerate-developer-productivity/blob/main/Coach/Solution/Exercise-03/Task-4/dotnet-deploy-1.yml) covers steps 1-5.
  - The [second version of the solution file](https://github.com/microsoft/TechExcel-Implementing-DevOps-practices-to-accelerate-developer-productivity/blob/main/Coach/Solution/Exercise-03/Task-4/dotnet-deploy-2.yml) adds in steps 6-12.
  - The [third version of the solution file](https://github.com/microsoft/TechExcel-Implementing-DevOps-practices-to-accelerate-developer-productivity/blob/main/Coach/Solution/Exercise-03/Task-4/dotnet-deploy-3.yml) adds in steps 13-15.
  - The [fourth version of the solution file](https://github.com/microsoft/TechExcel-Implementing-DevOps-practices-to-accelerate-developer-productivity/blob/main/Coach/Solution/Exercise-03/Task-4/dotnet-deploy-4.yml) adds in the advanced challenge.

{: .note }
> The deployment YAML files will not run on their own because they include sections which require developer input, such as `{your_prefix}` and `{your_registry_name}`. Filling these in with appropriate values is necessary to get the .yml files in the appropriate condition to run.

{: .note }
> The `images` command in each `webapps-deploy` call has a hard-coded value for the image location of `techboost/dotnetcoreapp` and expect you to hard-code the ACR location. This is because the `images` command will not accept repository secrets or variables defined in the workflow like the steps in the `dockerBuildPush` job do.
